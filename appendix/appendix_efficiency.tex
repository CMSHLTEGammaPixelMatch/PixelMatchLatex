\subsection{Complete list of efficiency plots}

To save space the efficiencies of all remaining variables are presented here.  Note that for barrel electrons in some parts of the spectra, the $\Delta\phi_2$ can give slightly better discrimination than $s_B$.  The efficiencies are shown in figures \ref{fig:eff_phi1_ea}-\ref{fig:eff_rz_ea}.

\subsection{Complete list of efficiency vs fake rate plots and tables}

The efficiency curves for \Zee and \QCD are shown in figures \ref{fig:multieff_phi1_ea}-\ref{fig:multieff_rz_ea}, and it can be seen that the barrel electrons give the best performance, and forward electrons give the worst performance.  The $s$ variables give the best discrimination between the \Zee and \QCD samples.

Signal and background efficiencies at different working points are shown in tables \ref{tab:eff_rej_phi1_beam_8_50_sig}-\ref{tab:eff_rej_rz_beam_13_25_bkg}.  In general the $s$ variables give the best performance, although for large signal efficiencies at $13\tev 25\ns$ for barrel electrons, $\Delta\phi_2$ performs marginally better than $s_B$.
