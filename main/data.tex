\section{Data and Monte Carlo samples}

This analysis uses the following data and Monte Carlo (MC) samples:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 2012 data from the /DoubleElectron/Run2012D-ZElectron-22Jan2013-v1/RAW-RECO (\DoubleElectron) sample
  \item Multijet MC from the \texttt{/QCD\_Pt\_30\_80\_EMEnriched\_TuneZ2star\_8TeV\_pythia6/\\Summer12\_DR53X-PU25bx50\_START53\_V19D-v1/\-GEN-SIM-RAW} (\QCDLowEnergy) sample
  \item Multijet MC from the \texttt{/QCD\_Pt\_30\_80\_EMEnriched\_TuneZ2star\_13TeV-pythia6/\\Summer13dr53X-PU25bx25\_START53\_V19D-v1/\-GEN-SIM-RAW} (\QCDHighEnergy) sample
  \item $Z\to ee$ MC from the \texttt{/DYToEE\_M\_20\_TuneZ2star\_8TeV\_pythia6/\\Summer12\_DR53X-PU25bx50\_START53\_V19D-v1/\-GEN-SIM-RAW} (\ZeeLowEnergy) sample
  \item $Z\to ee$  MC from the \texttt{/DYToEE\_Tune4C\_13TeV-pythia8/\\Fall13dr-tsg\_PU20bx25\_POSTLS162\_V2-v1/GEN-SIM-RAW} (\ZeeHighEnergy) sample
  \item $t\bar{t}$ MC from the \texttt{/TT\_Tune4C\_13TeV-pythia8-tauola/\\Fall13dr-tsg\_PU20bx25\_POSTLS162\_V2-v1/GEN-SIM-RAW} (\ttbar) sample
\end{itemize}

The lumi mask \texttt{Cert\_190456-203853\_8TeV\_PromptReco\_Collisions12\_JSON.txt} is used for the \DoubleElectron\ dataset.  The QCD MC samples are enriched in jets which fake electrons, with a $p_T$ range of $30-80 \gev$.  The motivation for using the \ttbar\ sample is to ensure that the trigger paths chosen work with the latest MC campaign, as well as showing that the pixel match window behaves well in an environment with real electrons and large numbers of jets.
