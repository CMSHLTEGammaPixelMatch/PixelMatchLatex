\section{Conclusion}

The tightening of the pixel window has the potential to best deliver very high signal efficiencies while simultaneously giving a significant reductions in the QCD fake rates.  As the trigger rate from fake electrons increases with instantaneous luminosity and pileup in LHC Run II the pixel window can be tightened in the three regions of the CMS detector to keep the rates under control.

\subsection{Recommendations}

The new pixel window module should be implemented which makes use of the $s$ variables.  A working point which has a signal efficiency of $99.5\%$ would give fake rate efficiencies of $79\%$, $94\%$, and $96\%$ for the barrel, intermediate, and forward electrons, respectively at $13\tev 25\ns$.  The pixel window can be revisited as changed simply as the rates increase with luminosity, targeting the barrel, intermediate and forward regions separately.
