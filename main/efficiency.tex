\subsection{Efficiency as a function of the $s$ variables}

Signal efficiencies and fake rates are estimated relative to the small window by counting events in which at least one electron candidates passes the selections.  Efficiencies as a function of the $s$ variables are shown in figure \ref{fig:eff_s_ea}.  The efficiences for the $t\bar{t}$ sample are shown to be marginally worse for intermediate and forward electrons than those in the $Z\to ee$ sample, indicating slightly worse performance for events with large numbers of jets.  The efficiency curves are similar between $8\tev$ and $13\tev$ samples.

The efficiency vs fake rates curves as a function of $s$ are shown in figure \ref{fig:multieff_s_ea} (with single electron trigger samples used as a crosscheck) and the efficiencies for given working points are shown in tables \ref{tab:eff_rej_s_beam_8_50_sig}-\ref{tab:eff_rej_s_beam_13_25_bkg}.  The chosen working points are $\varepsilon_{sig}=50\%, 90\%, 95\%, 99\%, 99.5\%$, and $\varepsilon_{bkg}=10\%, 30\%, 50\%, 70\%, 90\%$.  Typical fake rates for events firing the HLT\_Ele27\_WP80\_v13 trigger at a working point of $\varepsilon_{sig}=95\%$ are $33\% (35\%)$ at $8\tev(13\tev)$ for barrel electrons, $52\% (42\%)$ at $8\tev(13\tev)$ for intermediate electrons, and $66\% (69\%)$ at $8\tev(13\tev)$ for forward electrons, indicating good separation of signal and backgrounds.  Results are similar between the events firing the single and the events firing double electron triggers.
